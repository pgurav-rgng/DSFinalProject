## Time Series Prediction using fb Prophet Pkg as Final Project
Data Science Final project using Stock Prediction

The main objective of this project is to develop a shiny App and host it on shiny platform. This App uses various controls such as Text field, radio buttons and Graphical output as a consequence of user choices.

The main concept I used in this app is to predict stock values using an existing ML algorithm. I have tried ARIMA as well, but I chose to use 'Prophet' algorithm developed by Facebook in this App. For more information refer [Prophet documentation](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)

The R code used in the analysis can be found here github link [Code Github](https://github.com/pgurav-rgng/DSFinalProject)

This project contains two files ui.R & server.R. These files develop a shiny app
Also it has a markdown file "StockPredictUsingProphet-PG.Rmd" and an html presentation output file "StockPredictUsingProphet-PG.html"

Proj1.png & Proj2.png image files are used in the markdown file.
